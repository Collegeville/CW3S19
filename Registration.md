#### Housing

During the summer months, student apartments and dorms are available for visitors.  Available rooms are:

- **Single room, Placid Apartments, air conditioned with bath ($55/night):** The Placid apartments have six private bedrooms with private bathrooms.  There is a shared kitchen and laundry room.  Picking this option gives you your own small hotel room with Internet, sink and shower that is reached by entering the apartment and climbing stairs to your own room.  **This option requires the ability to use stairs.**
- **Single room, Benet Hall air conditioned with bath ($55/night):** The Benet Hall rooms are more traditional college dorms with private baths.  These rooms are very close to the workshop meeting room and are handicap accessible.
- **Single room, Flynn Town Apartments, 2 person apartment with individual bath ($45/night):** Flynn Town apartments come with a private room and a separate bathroom.  This option would be most appealing to attendees who want to coordinate accommodations with one other person or a family.

#### Meals

St. John's Refectory provides a one-price buffet with salad bar and a variety of entrees and desserts.  Meals can be purchased at the cashier desk.  An 8-meal packet of punches is also an option, with a reduced per-meal cost.

#### Off-Campus Accommodations

St. John's is about 15 miles west of St. Cloud, MN.  If you prefer a more standard hotel arrangement, there are many hotels in the St. Cloud area, less than 30 minutes from campus by car.

## Workshop Goals

The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction in the sustainability of scientific software.  We want to explore, characterize and articulate scientific software practices from industry, research labs and academia and identify common requirements and essential differences in these communities.

We will write a workshop report describing our findings and articulating research priorities that will advanced the sustainability of scientific software, especially toward better usability across industry, lab and academic institutions.

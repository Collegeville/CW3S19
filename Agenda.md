### Workshop Goals
The goal of this workshop is to bring together community leaders and practitioners in scientific software for the purpose of identifying the challenges and priority research direction in the sustainability of scientific software.  

### Background
Sustainability is essential to progress in scientific software.  As software ecoystems evolve toward inter-operable and complementary components and the demands for reproducible computational science increase, improved sustainability becomes increasingly important.

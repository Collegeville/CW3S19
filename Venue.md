## St. John's University, MN

[St. John's University](https://www.csbsju.edu/about/saint-johns-university) is located on 2,500 acres of wooded hills with miles of walking trails among lakes and wildlife.  In this setting, we hope to bring together a diverse group of people who care about sustainable scientific software.

In addition to hiking, the campus beach supplies canoes, paddleboards and swimming area on Lake Sagatagan, a pristine spring-fed lake.

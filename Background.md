## Background

Sustainability is essential to progress in scientific software. As software ecoystems evolve toward inter-operable and complementary components and the demands for reproducible computational science increase, improved sustainability becomes increasingly important.

One way to characterize the computational and data sciences communities is through their institutions.  Three distinct categories of institutions are corporations, research labs and universities.  While a particular institution may exhibit characteristics across these categories, each category tends to have a distinct business model and set of priorities.

While we have distinct categories, the broad scientific software ecosystem is inter-dependent and complementary where products from one category are widely used in others.  Even more interaction is possible if the scientific software community can come to understand commonalities and differences, and work toward better understanding and concrete actions.
